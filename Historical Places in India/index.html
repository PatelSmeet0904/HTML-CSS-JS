                            One can go on praising the Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with an uninterrupted
                            flow of adjectives – magnificent, outstanding, amazing and incredible. However, none of
                            those can
                            accurately do justice to its beauty. The only way to do that is to visit this incredible
                            structure made of pure white marble. Everything about it reflects grandeur, from its
                            minarets to
                            its dome.

                        <p>
                            Shah Jahan had this monument built for his wife Mumtaz to express his undying love for her,
                            and
                            today, lovers cite this as an example when expressing their love to each other. The
                            construction
                            of the Taj Mahal, which is also one of the must visit UNESCO World Heritage Sites In India,
                            took
                            around 22 years to complete, and no wonder, the effort of every year is reflected in its
                            construction.

                            The royal class has always had its own way of doing things, and so did the royal ladies of
                            Jaipur. Jaipur is also one of the most popular historic places in India. Belonging to
                            royalty required them to observe the “purdah” system constantly. However, they were also
                            curious about the happenings of the outside world. To satisfy this curiosity, Maharaja Sawai
                            Pratap Singh had the Hawa Mahal built for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Upon visiting it the first time, you will notice that the Hawa Mahal also looks like a
                            crown. This is because the Maharaja who built it was a major devotee of Lord Krishna. Also
                            known as the “Palace of Winds”, it was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. It resembles a honeycomb
                            of a beehive with its 953 intricate windows. Upon visiting it the first time, you will
                            notice that the Hawa Mahal is shaped like a crown. Explore popular attractions in Jaipur

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a symbol of the Mughal Empire at its peak. The
                            enormous size, aesthetic proportions and style, all represent an age of unrestrained
                            opulence. Amidst the unceasing bustle of Old Delhi, stands this colossal monument, evoking
                            nothing but admiration from the onlookers.

                        </p>
                        Red Fort, which is one of the popular forts and palaces in India, was also built by the Mughal
                        emperor, Shah Jahan. It took over 10 years to complete, and was constructed when the emperor
                        decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Back then, the fort was known as
                        Qila-e-Mubarak. It is from the ramparts of Red Fort that the Prime Minister delivers his speech
                        on Independence Day.

                            The Qutub Minar, another UNESCO World Heritage Site, is an incredible example of Indo-Muslim
                            architecture that touches the skies at an incredible height of 240ft. It is named after
                            Qutub-ud-din Aibak, the first Muslim ruler of North India. The place where Qutub Minar
                            stands is usually regarded as the site of the first Muslim kingdom in northern India.

                        <p>
                            Rani-ki-Vav, on the banks of the Saraswati River, was initially built as a memorial to a
                            king in the 11th century AD. Stepwells are a distinctive form of subterranean water resource
                            and storage systems on the Indian subcontinent, and have been constructed since the 3rd
                            millennium BC. They evolved over time from what was basically a pit in sandy soil towards
                            elaborate multi-storey works of art and architecture.
                            Designed as an inverted temple highlighting the sanctity of water, it is divided into seven
                            levels of stairs with sculptural panels of high artistic quality; more than 500 principle
                            sculptures and over a thousand minor ones combine religious, mythological and secular
                            imagery, often referencing literary works. The fourth level is the deepest and leads into a
                            rectangular tank 9.5 m by 9.4 m, at a depth of 23 m. The well is located at the westernmost
                            end of the property and consists of a shaft 10 m in diameter and 30 m deep.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Fatehpur Sikri is located in Agra District in the State of Uttar Pradesh in northern India.
                            It was constructed southeast of an artificial lake, on the slopping levels of the outcrops
                            of the Vindhyan hill ranges. Known as the “city of victory”, it was made capital by the
                            Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605 CE) and constructed between 1571 and 1573. Fatehpur Sikri
                            was the first planned city of the Mughals to be marked by magnificent administrative,
                            residential, and religious buildings comprised of palaces, public buildings, mosques, and
                            living areas for the court, the army, the servants of the king and an entire city. Upon
                            moving the capital to Lahore in 1585, Fatehpur Sikri remained as an area for temporary
                            visits by the Mughal emperors.

                            Another of the most famous historical places in India are the Ajanta and Ellora Caves in
                            Maharashtra. Both of them are UNESCO World Heritage Sites and draw tourists in impressive
                            numbers. The sculptures and artifacts in the caves belong to three different religions:
                            Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism. There are 12 Buddhist, 17 Hindu and 5 Jain caves.

                        </p>
                        It was in these caves, which were in fact Buddhist monasteries that the monks prayed, studied
                        and meditated. The credit for discovering these famous caves goes to the British officer John
                        Smith who stumbled upon these historic sites while he was out on a tiger hunt in 1819. The
                        artifacts in the caves depict the past lives and rebirths of Gautam Buddha.

                            resplendent glory and fame. What artistic passions must have led to the creation of this
                            marvel, one wonders. It was built by King Narasimhadeva I, the great ruler of the Ganga
                            dynasty, along with 1200 artisans in stone. The temple, which is devoted to the Sun God
                            “Surya”, leaves everyone enchanted with the fabulous Kalinga architecture. The crowd pullers
                            are undoubtedly the gigantic chariot, pillars and walls which lend the temple an authentic
                            touch of Odisha. European sailors famously referred to this structure as the “Black Pagoda”.
                            Another remarkable feature of the temple is to be found at its gate, where there is a
                            depiction of two lions crushing elephants along with a human body lying at the foot of the
                            elephant.

                            These beautiful temples are adorned with brilliantly carved statues and sculptures which
                            reflect the various aspects of Kama Sutra. However, there are other attractions to check out
                            inside these temples besides the sensual sculptures. These marvelous temples which were
                            built by the Chandelas are a group of Hindu and Jain temples. They also reflect the

                            The Victoria Memorial, one of the top historical places in Kolkata, is the brainchild of
                            Lord Curzon, a Viceroy of India. When Queen Victoria, who was the Empress of British India,
                            died in January 1901, Curzon suggested building a grand memorial to honor her. He proposed
                            the memorial to be a stately edifice with a museum where visitors get a glimpse of the
                            marvels of the past. The foundation for the memorial was laid on 4 January 1906 by the
                            Prince of Wales, who later became King George V.

                            One of the most famous Gurudwara in the entire world, Sri Harmandir Sahib is one of the
                            important spiritual places in India. While it has been around for a long while, it was
                            rebuilt with pure gold and marble in 1830 by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Located in the heart of
                            Amritsar, it is visited by more than a hundred thousand pilgrims every day.

                            architecture. Built at a level lower than the surrounding land level, The Gurudwara teaches
                            the lesson of egalitarianism and humility. The four entrances of this holy shrine from all
                            four directions, signify that people belonging to every walk of life are equally welcome.

                            Hampi or Hampe, also referred to as the Group of Monuments at Hampi, is a UNESCO World
                            Heritage Site located in Hampi town, Vijayanagara district, east-central Karnataka, India.

                            Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century. It is a fortified
                            city. Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, say
                            that Hampi was a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra River, with
                            numerous temples, farms and trading markets. The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a
                            coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered, pillaged and destroyed by
                            sultanate armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins.
